# Zoo Reports Service

This is the **Reports API** for managing zoo-related reports. Built with **FastAPI**, it handles operations such as report submissions, updates, and retrievals. It is part of a larger microservices-based architecture for zoo management.

## Features

- CRUD operations for reports.
- Management of report types, statuses, and related entities.
- Integration with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with JWT authentication.
- API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc.
