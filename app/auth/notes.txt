In a FastAPI project, the folder for authentication (`auth`) logic should typically be placed in the **`app/`** directory (or your main application folder). It’s common to separate it into its own folder to maintain modularity and readability.

### Recommended Placement

**Structure:**

```
zoo-***-service/
├── app/
│   ├── auth/            # Authentication logic
│   │   ├── jwt.py       # JWT handling (token generation/validation)
│   │   ├── models.py    # Auth-related models (e.g., User, Role)
│   │   ├── routes.py    # Authentication-related API routes (login, register)
│   │   ├── services.py  # Business logic for authentication
│   │   ├── utils.py     # Helper functions (e.g., password hashing)
│   ├── routers/         # API endpoints
│   ├── models/          # Database models
│   ├── schemas/         # Pydantic schemas
│   ├── services/        # Business logic for other domains
│   ├── constants.py     # Constants (e.g., roles)
│   ├── __init__.py      # Package initialization
├── alembic/             # Database migrations
├── main.py              # FastAPI entry point
```

### Why Use an `auth/` Folder?
1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Keeps all authentication-related code (JWT, password handling, user roles) in one place.
2. **Scalability**:
   - As your project grows, modularity ensures maintainability.
3. **Reusability**:
   - Helper functions in `auth/utils.py` (e.g., password hashing) can be reused across the app.

### Key Components of the `auth/` Folder
1. **`jwt.py`**:
   - Handles token creation, validation, and expiration logic.

2. **`models.py`**:
   - Defines authentication-related database models (e.g., `User`, `Role`).

3. **`routes.py`**:
   - Defines endpoints for authentication, like `login` and `register`.

4. **`services.py`**:
   - Contains reusable authentication logic, such as verifying user credentials.

5. **`utils.py`**:
   - Includes helper functions, like hashing passwords or extracting user claims from tokens.

This structure makes your project modular and enterprise-ready, while keeping authentication logic clean and manageable.
